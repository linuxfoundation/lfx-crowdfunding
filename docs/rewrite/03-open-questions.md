## Infrastructure & Networking

### OQ-1: Can K8s cluster reach Lambda API Gateway endpoints?

**Status:** Resolved
**Owner:** Architect

**Resolution:** Both Ledger and Reimbursement Service APIs are reachable over public HTTPS from K8s.

The new CF service only calls the Reimbursement Service for one purpose: expense approval/rejection (`POST /expense/{action}/{reportID}`) triggered via JWT email links. Project/entity sync to Expensify (create/update policy) stays on the old Lambda for the initial release and is not ported.

---

### OQ-2: Is the Ledger API URL public HTTPS or private VPC?

**Status:** Resolved
**Resolution:** Ledger API is public HTTPS. Confirmed by Lewis. No VPC peering or additional network configuration needed. CF K8s service can call Ledger API directly over HTTPS. OQ-1 is also resolved for the Ledger dependency.

---

### OQ-3: Mentorship → CF data sync mechanism

**Status:** Resolved
**Owner:** Michal / Architect

**Resolution:** SNS/SQS is dropped entirely. CF syncs Mentorship program data from Snowflake via a periodic K8s CronJob.

**Rationale:**
- Mentorship and CF run in separate AWS accounts. Cross-account SNS/SQS subscriptions require coordination with the Mentorship team and their AWS account — not something CF can do unilaterally.
- Mentorship is moving to Kubernetes in the coming months, making Lambda-era SNS/SQS infrastructure a poor long-term investment.
- Both Mentorship and CF mirror their data into Snowflake. CF can pull mentorship program data from Snowflake directly.
- A 24h sync delay is acceptable: new mentorship programs are not immediately donation-ready by business requirement, and mentees/beneficiaries don't access funds until mid-term (months after program creation).

**How it works:**
- CF runs a K8s CronJob (`mentorship-sync`) that queries Snowflake for mentorship programs and creates/updates `initiative_type = mentorship` rows in the CF Postgres DB.
- CF no longer publishes SNS events back to Mentorship — those were only needed for the old bidirectional sync.
- The five direct HTTP calls from the old system (slug sync, funding status, title-check, addbeneficiary, removebeneficiary) are all eliminated — either because the data is available in Snowflake or because the use case no longer applies.

**No Mentorship code changes required for the integration.** All data flows through Snowflake. Mentorship does not call CF APIs directly in the new system.

### OQ-4: GitHub repo `linuxfoundation/lfx-crowdfunding` — created and visibility confirmed?

**Status:** Resolved
**Owner:** DevOps

**Resolution:** Repo was created and subsequently renamed to `linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-crowdfunding`. This is the repo where implementation lives.

---

### OQ-5: ArgoCD app for Crowdfunding K8s deployment

**Status:** Resolved
**Owner:** DevOps

**Resolution:** Namespace is `crowdfunding` — consistent with the LFX ArgoCD pattern (logical service name, no `lfx-v2-` prefix; e.g. `query-service`, `committee-service`, `ui`). ArgoCD entry goes in `lfx-v2-applications.yaml`; Helm chart at `charts/lfx-v2-crowdfunding/` in this repo.

## Data & Stripe

### OQ-6: Hardcoded Stripe Plan IDs / Product IDs outside DynamoDB?

**Status:** Resolved
**Owner:** Michal

**Resolution:** Queried production data via Snowflake (`FIVETRAN_INGEST.DYNAMODB_PRODUCT_US_EAST_1.LFF_PROD_PROJECTS`). Findings:

- **356 projects** have `stripe_plan_id` and `stripe_product_id` populated — the majority are mentorship-type programs.
- **104 active subscriptions** have a `stripeSubscriptionId` — these are live recurring charges in Stripe.
- No Stripe Plan IDs or Product IDs found hardcoded outside DynamoDB (no SSM parameters, Terraform, or config files reference specific plan/product IDs).

**Migration requirement:** All Stripe Plan IDs, Product IDs, and subscription IDs must be migrated as-is to the new Postgres tables. Active subscriptions continue charging against the original Stripe plan — changing or omitting these IDs would break recurring billing. The `subscriptions` table must have a UNIQUE constraint on `stripe_subscription_id` to preserve data integrity.

## Dependencies

### OQ-7: Reimbursement Service OpenSearch dependency — long-term plan

**Status:** Resolved
**Owner:** Michal

**Resolution:** Two-phase migration with hard decommission deadline of CF release + 2 weeks.

**Phase 1 — on CF release day:**
RS switches Category 1 reads (CF-owned data) from OpenSearch to direct SQL on CF Postgres:
- `projects` OpenSearch index → `SELECT id, name, owner_id FROM crowdfunding.initiatives WHERE initiative_type IN ('project', 'mentorship') AND status = 'published'`
- `entities` OpenSearch index → `SELECT id, name, owner_id FROM crowdfunding.initiatives WHERE initiative_type IN ('general_fund', 'event', 'ostif') AND status = 'published'`
- `lff-users` OpenSearch index → `SELECT owner_id, email FROM crowdfunding.users`

RS gets a read-only Postgres role on `crowdfunding` schema. No HTTP API layer between RS and CF — direct DB connection. These are the reads used by `RefreshTags()` (Expensify GL code sync) and `getEmailBySlug()` (project owner email lookup).

**Phase 2 — CF release + 2 weeks (hard deadline):**
RS migrates Category 2 indices (RS-owned data) from OpenSearch to the `reimbursement` schema on the CF Postgres instance:

| OpenSearch index | Replacement | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `lfx-expense-log` | `reimbursement.expense_log` table | Email send idempotency records |
| `beneficiary-actions` | `reimbursement.beneficiary_actions` table | Pending add/remove work queue |
| `travel-funds-tickets` | `reimbursement.travel_fund_tickets` table | Ticket→beneficiary mapping |

All three are simple key-value access patterns (get by ID, get by action type) — no full-text search. Schema is ~65 lines SQL, implementation ~100 lines Go replacing `ElasticRepository` calls with SQL queries.

OpenSearch decommissions on CF release + 2 weeks. Not "when we get to it."

**Notes:**
- RS tables live on the CF Postgres instance under the `reimbursement` schema — same connection, separate schema, separate role
- `beneficiary-actions` remove path is fully commented out in RS (`PolicyEmployeesRemove` at service.go:919) — migration of this index is low risk
- Existing `lfx-expense-log` data must be migrated before cutover to preserve email deduplication history
- Old CF Lambda has zero OpenSearch writes — verify who populates `projects`/`entities` OpenSearch indices today before Phase 1 cutover

### OQ-13: Reimbursement Service expense approval — how does auth work?

**Status:** Open
**Owner:** Lewis / Michal

**Question:** When the Reimbursement Service sends an expense approval email to a project admin, the link in that email eventually hits the CF UI. The UI then calls the CF API, which calls the RS to approve/reject. This was discussed in the May 5 architecture review but the exact auth mechanism was not resolved.

Specifically:
- Does the link in the email go directly to the RS endpoint, or to the CF UI (which then calls the RS)?
- Lewis confirmed the link goes to the UI first, which authenticates the user and then calls the RS. But: how does the CF API authenticate to the RS when forwarding the approval? API key? Signed token?
- In the current system, RS uses an API key for backend-to-backend calls. Is this the same key the new CF Go service will use?

**Blocking:** RS approval forwarding (`POST /expense/{action}/{reportID}`) in the new Go API. Must be resolved before implementing that endpoint.

**Action:** Lewis to confirm the RS endpoint auth mechanism and provide the API key config name used in the current system.

### OQ-12: Can Reimbursement Service Lambda reach CF Postgres on K8s?

**Status:** Open
**Owner:** DevOps / Architect (raised by Eric Searcy, May 2026)

**Question:** The Reimbursement Service runs as a Lambda function inside its own AWS VPC. The CF Postgres instance is on the shared LFX v2 RDS, reachable from K8s via an in-cluster ExternalName service (`rds-postgres.lfx:5432`). These are in separate AWS accounts / VPCs.

For OQ-7 Phase 1 and Phase 2 to work (RS reading `crowdfunding` schema and owning `reimbursement` schema via direct Postgres connection), RS Lambda must be able to reach the RDS endpoint.

**Options to investigate:**
- Is the shared LFX v2 RDS instance publicly accessible (like the Ledger API)? If yes, RS Lambda can connect directly with credentials.
- If RDS is private, VPC peering or an AWS PrivateLink between the RS VPC and the LFX v2 VPC is required — needs DevOps coordination.

**Blocking:** OQ-7 Phase 1 (CF release day). Must be resolved before RS can switch off OpenSearch for CF data reads.

### OQ-8: New Auth0 application for rewritten Crowdfunding

**Status:** Resolved — PR merged at [linuxfoundation/auth0-terraform#299](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/auth0-terraform/pull/299)
**Owner:** Michal

**Resolution:** `auth0_client.lfx_crowdfunding` created as `regular_web` app in all three tenants (dev, staging, prod) with `authorization_code` + `refresh_token` grants, RS256 JWT, rotating refresh tokens, and PKCE-compatible server-side token exchange. Callback path: `/api/auth/callback`.

Pending: DevOps to share the new `client_id` values per tenant so they can be set in `NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` env vars (via AWS Secrets Manager / ESO). The old Auth0 app (`CB Funding`) stays active until the old Lambda stack is decommissioned.

---

### OQ-9: Mentorship → CF direct HTTP calls — will they work post-cutover?

**Status:** Resolved — moot
**Owner:** Architect / Mentorship team

**Resolution:** All five direct HTTP calls from Mentorship to CF have been eliminated. Mentorship no longer calls CF APIs directly — all data flows through Snowflake. The `FUNDING_API_URL` config in Mentorship can be removed when Mentorship moves to Kubernetes. No DNS or network path coordination needed.

---

## Design

### OQ-10: UI prototype — final design or rough reference?

**Status:** Resolved
**Owner:** Michal / Design

**Resolution:** The prototype is a rough reference only. The UI designer is still finalizing the design. Implement functionally using PrimeVue components — do not spend time on pixel-perfect matching against the prototype. UI will be updated once final designs are delivered.

---

### OQ-11: Full scope of CF data needed in LFX One

**Status:** Open — blocked on PM + design
**Owner:** Michal / PM

**Question:** The PM has requested "My Donations" and "My Initiatives" in LFX One, but the full list of CF data surfaces is not confirmed. Before any LFX One integration code is written, this must be clarified:

- What exactly is shown per widget — count, amount total, list of items, grouped by project?
- Which data types: donations only, or also subscriptions, owned projects, owned funds?
- Is there an empty state design?
- Are cancelled subscriptions / declined projects shown or hidden?

**Blocked on:** UI design for the LFX One CF widgets. No implementation until design is delivered and the full data list is confirmed.

**Integration approach:** Snowflake (Option B) via Fivetran CF→Snowflake sync. See decision in `02-decisions.md`.

## Resolved Questions (for reference)

| # | Question | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| R-1 | Does LFF write directly to Ledger DB? | No — LFF calls Ledger HTTP API read-only. Ledger writes come from its own Stripe/Expensify webhooks. |
| OQ-1 | Can K8s reach Lambda API Gateway endpoints? | Yes — both reachable over public HTTPS. CF only calls RS for expense approval/rejection; project sync stays on old Lambda. |
| OQ-3 | Mentorship → CF sync mechanism | SNS/SQS dropped. All data (programs + beneficiaries) via Snowflake CronJob. Zero direct HTTP calls between Mentorship and CF. |
| OQ-4 | GitHub repo created? | Yes — created as `linuxfoundation/lfx-crowdfunding`, renamed to `linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-crowdfunding`. |
| OQ-5 | ArgoCD namespace for CF K8s deployment | `crowdfunding` namespace. Helm chart in `charts/lfx-v2-crowdfunding/` in the CF repo; ArgoCD entry in `lfx-v2-applications.yaml`. |
| OQ-6 | Stripe Plan/Product IDs outside DynamoDB? | 356 projects have Stripe plan/product IDs (mostly mentorship programs); 104 active subscriptions. All must be migrated as-is. No IDs hardcoded outside DynamoDB. |
| OQ-7 | RS OpenSearch migration plan | Two-phase migration. CF release day: RS reads CF data from Postgres. CF release + 2 weeks (hard deadline): RS migrates its own indices to `reimbursement` schema on CF Postgres. |
| OQ-8 | New Auth0 app for rewritten CF | Merged — `auth0_client.lfx_crowdfunding` created in all 3 tenants as `regular_web` with PKCE. Pending: DevOps to share new `client_id` values per tenant for ESO secrets. Old app stays active until Lambda decommission. |
| OQ-9 | Mentorship → CF direct HTTP calls post-cutover | Moot — all five calls eliminated. Mentorship no longer calls CF. Data flows through Snowflake. |
| OQ-10 | UI prototype fidelity | Rough reference only. Implement functionally with PrimeVue; update once designer delivers final designs. |
| R-2 | Does Reimbursement Service query Crowdfunding OpenSearch? | Yes — reads `projects`, `entities`, `lff-users`, `spring-projects`, `spring-users`, `beneficiary-actions`, `travel-funds-tickets`. Writes `lfx-expense-log`, `beneficiary-actions`, `travel-funds-tickets`. Migration plan in OQ-7. |
| R-3 | Who owns the Mentorship SNS topic? | Mentorship (jobspring) owns it. CF is a subscriber. Topic: `lfx-topic-{stage}-project`. CF queue: `fundspring-lfx-queues-{stage}-project`. |
| R-4 | Is there a separate admin UI for project approvals? | No. Approvals are done via HMAC-signed token links in emails sent to the CF approver (Sriji, LFID: `shubhrakar`). The token encodes the initiative ID and action — no Auth0 login required to click the link. |
| R-5 | Should Expensify sync be rewritten for initial release? | No. Keep old Lambda running it. Not end-user visible. Reimbursement Service unchanged. |
| R-6 | Is lfx-v1-sync-helper useful for CF DB migration? | No. It syncs project/committee metadata via NATS KV. Does not touch CF donations, subscriptions, or Ledger data. |
| OQ-12 | Can RS Lambda reach CF Postgres on K8s? | Open — must confirm RDS is publicly accessible or arrange VPC peering. Blocks OQ-7 Phase 1. |
